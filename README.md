## Introduction

DEVELOPMENT STOPPED

This game is the alpha of a minimalistic online RTS game.
I made it to learn swift in-depth and noticed some person liked to play it so here it is.
You just need two apple devices with Gamecenter, then you launch the matchmaking and you can play against each other.

## Gameplay

The idea is to harvest ressources, build buildings and units and then attack your enemies. You just need to click on a single unit and a location to make it move there and perform an action if it can (Peasant would harvest wheat if their target location is wheat, warriors would attack ennemies in sight)
You can also select multiple units with two fingers like in most RTS game

## Strategy

The idea behind this game is that I wanted various strategies to exist on it like destroying windmills so that enemies units die because of a lack of food or by destroying farms.
